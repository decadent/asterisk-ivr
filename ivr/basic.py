    The __init__ method may be documented in either the class level
    docstring, or as a docstring on the __init__ method itself.

    Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose one
    convention to document the __init__ method and be consistent with it.

    Note:
        Do not include the `self` parameter in the ``Args`` section.

    Args:
        msg (str): Human readable string describing the exception.
        code (:obj:`int`, optional): Error code.

    Attributes:
        msg (str): Human readable string describing the exception.
        code (int): Exception error code.
