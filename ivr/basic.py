Asterisk Configuration File
######################################################
This module is used to read the database settings from an Asterisk configuration file.  It uses the Python ConfigParser to load the setting values directly from the specified section (context) of the Asterisk configuration file.

.. note:: You need the `MySQL Connector/Python <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/>`_ installed on your system to connect to the database.

Example:
    Import the module, get the config settings, and pass them to your mysql connection::

        import ivr.connection
        config = ivr.connection.config
        database = mysql.connect(**config)

    """Exceptions are documented in the same way as classes.

    The __init__ method may be documented in either the class level
    docstring, or as a docstring on the __init__ method itself.

    Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose one
    convention to document the __init__ method and be consistent with it.

    Note:
        Do not include the `self` parameter in the ``Args`` section.

    Args:
        msg (str): Human readable string describing the exception.
        code (:obj:`int`, optional): Error code.

    Attributes:
        msg (str): Human readable string describing the exception.
        code (int): Exception error code.
