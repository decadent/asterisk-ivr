Database Connection Using Asterisk Settings
======================================================

This module is used to read the database settings from an Asterisk configuration file.  It uses the Python ConfigParser to load the setting values directly from the specified section (context) of the Asterisk configuration file.

.. note:: You need the `MySQL Connector/Python <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/>`_ installed on your system to connect to the database.

Example:
    Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
    sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
    literal blocks::

        import ivr.connection
        config = ivr.connection.config
        database = mysql.connect(**config)

"""

asterisk_path = '/etc/asterisk'
"""int: Module level variable documented inline.

The path to your asterisk configuration files.
